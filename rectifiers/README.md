Scripts to generate the graphs for the report

## Requirements

You need matplotlib, PyQt5, numpy, pandas and MikTex. You can install MikTek by looking for it on the internet and you can use pip to install the required modules.



## Usage

Fill the `data.xlsx` file, do not change its structure, run the `graphs.py` script with Python. The "figure" folder will be created and all the graphics will be generated.
